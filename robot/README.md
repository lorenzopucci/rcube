# Robot solver
This is the code I used to build a Rubik's cube solver robot with 6 stepper
motors and a Raspberry Pi.

## Compiling
Before compiling the robot part, the `lib` and `ui` targets of `../Makefile`
must have been met. Then, move to this folder and run `make robot`. The
results will be in `./bin`.
